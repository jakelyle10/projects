This is an arduino project using Edge Impulse, an Arduino BLE Sense 33, an MQ-3 Sensor, and the Grove Chainable RGB LED. The goal is essentially to predict if one is 'functionally' drunk - if there is alcohol vapor being detected on your breath, and if you're slurring your words. The user breathes into the MQ-3 sensor, and once the light turns blue either say the word 'specificity' or 'transubstantion.' The model will then try to predict whether you're drunk or sober based on the audio data you provided.
In order to recreate, one can either download the files in this repository, or directly from Edge Impulse and exporting to an Arduino library: https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/public/165530/latest 
I also imported the Chainable LED library, and the library for the 4 digit display (named TM1637, not actively working due to improper shield, however the functionality is built in and commented out). 
Power point for final presentation in University of St. Thomas's SEIS744 'IoT w/ Machine Learning' is also included.
